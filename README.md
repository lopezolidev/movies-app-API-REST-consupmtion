# Hi there!
	

 - This is an API-consumption practice repo.
 - I'm using [The Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) as my tools for building the core of this project.
 - Other technologies: 
	  - HTML, CSS and Javscript  vanilla
 ## What's this project about?
Interacting with the Move DB API, to create a MoviesApp where you can see trending movies, by genre, recommended according to a specific movie, movie details and look for movies in particular in a browsing section
## Where can I see it?
[Here](https://lopezolidev.github.io/movies-app-API-REST-consupmtion/src/index.html)

## What I've learned?
	

 - Manipulating extensively the information from an API.
 - Manipulating the DOM to navigate through different views in the app and not calling the API for rendering elements in the HTML.
 - Array and object manipulation to render images and text in an automated way along the development of the app.
 - Implementing DRY principle to optimize segments of the logic of the app when doing similar calls to the API.
 
I'm appreciated of [Platzi's course](https://platzi.com/cursos/api-practico/) ðŸ’š for helping me learn and complete this project. 
 
Remember to *Never stop learning !*
